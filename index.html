                <h2>Key Questions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is it safe? <img src="images/safety.jpg" alt="Safety"></li>
                    <li>Is it livable? <img src="images/livability.jpg" alt="Livability"></li>
                    <li>Is it affordable? <img src="images/affordability.jpg" alt="Affordability"></li>
                    <li>Is it accommodating to their needs? <img src="images/needs.jpg" alt="Needs"></li>
                    <li>Is it accommodating to their religious duties? <img src="images/religious.jpg" alt="Religious Duties"></li>

                </ul>
                <p>These questions address the fundamental aspects of refugee resettlement and integration. Safety is a primary concern, as refugees need to feel secure in their new homes. Livability encompasses the overall quality of life, including access to essential services and community resources. Affordability is critical, as many refugees face financial challenges upon arrival. Meeting the specific needs of refugees, including healthcare, education, and employment, is essential for their successful integration.</p>
                <p>Religious and cultural accommodation are also vital, as refugees bring diverse beliefs and practices that enrich the community. Ensuring that there are adequate places of worship and cultural centers helps refugees maintain their identity while adapting to their new environment.</p>
